In today‚Äôs data-driven world, businesses across various industry verticals increasingly leverage the Internet of Things (IoT) to drive efficiency and innovation. IoT is transforming how industries operate and make decisions, from agriculture to mining, energy utilities, and traffic management.

Agricultural businesses use IoT sensors to automate irrigation systems, while mining and water supply organizations traditionally rely on SCADA to optimize and monitor water distribution, quality, and consumption.

Mining and public transportation organizations commonly rely on IoT to monitor vehicle status and performance and ensure fuel efficiency and operational safety.

As businesses increasingly embrace these technologies, integrating IoT metrics with advanced observability solutions like Dynatrace becomes essential to gaining additional business value through end-to-end observability.

Dynatrace offers a feature-rich agent, Dynatrace OneAgent¬Æ, and an agentless open source approach perfectly tailored for edge-IoT use cases, leveraging OpenTelemetry. Both methods allow you to ingest and process raw data and metrics.

In the following sections, we‚Äôll explore how aircraft monitoring fits into this broader IoT landscape and how to implement OpenTelemetry and Dynatrace to enhance the monitoring and management capabilities of IoT data in aviation.
