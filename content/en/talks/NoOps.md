#### Talk Summary

If you know how to respond to a situation why not automate the response?

NoOps (no operations) is a concept that an IT environment can become so automated and abstracted from the underlying infrastructure that there is no need for a dedicated team to manage software in-house.

AWS provides variety of tools to perform automation and in this talk we will show you some of the tools and interconnect them to automate in efforts to reduce operational overhead.

At the end of this talk the audience would know where to look for opportunities to automate the typical alerts and resolve issues as they arrive with No Operational (NoOps) or human intervention.
