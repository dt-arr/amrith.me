#### Talk Summary

Organisations spend too much time on manual and repetitive work due to many diverse tools, compliance challenges, and inconsistent, tribal knowledge-based approaches. To address this, DevSecOps teams must go beyond getting data into dashboards, and drive automation in context to get answers from observability, security and business data. In this session, learn how Dynatrace is delivering both event-driven and workflow-based automations that identifies problems and performs automated root cause analysis, accurately identifying all issues related to a single root cause to ensure robust and secure continuous delivery.
