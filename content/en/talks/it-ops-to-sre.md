#### Talk Summary

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) has moved centre stage as enterprises look to harness hybrid or multicloud to accelerate digital transformation whilst ensuring systems stay reliable, resilient, and available.

So, how does one transition and mature their approach to Modern Operations and Service Management? How can enterprises move from the traditional ITOps practice to adopting a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) approach to cope with the growing complexities of data explosion, the pace of change, and the variety of tech stacks?

Join this session as we take you through the required practices and, more importantly, the things to avoid (battle-tested donâ€™t-dos and lessons) when it comes to establishing a maturity roadmap that orchestrates people, incident management practices, and supporting tools.
